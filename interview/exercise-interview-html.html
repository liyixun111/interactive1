    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I am a graphic design major student at CCA as an international student.</p>
    <p>I have been the United States for two and a half years. </p>
    <p>I went to language school in San Diego and then went to college in Boston as a freshman. After the first year at
      Boston, I decided to transfer to San Francisco to go to art school. My first semester at CCA was last fall2018
      and
      this spring semester is my second semester as a sophomore. I do enjoy taking graphic design major courses here!</p>
    <h4>1. What is 'good' screen-based design?</h4>
    <p>Simple but direct and clear. If it's too decorative, it looks chaotic and hard to recognize the picture.</p>
    <h4>2. How is art-making online different then art-making offline?</h4>
    <p>Online art looks digital and accurate while offline art feels human-made, containing more own Individuality.</p>
    <h4>3. What do you think is the 'purpose' of the web? </h4>
    <p>There are tons of websites nowadays and each website has its purpose with each different purpose. In other
      words,
      <em>"Different kinds of websites have different purposes depending on who the intended audience is. Some websites
        are geared towards selling products and other websites are geared toward s providing practical information,
        while
        others are merely for entertainment."</em> Likewise, websites functions differently for their purposes.</p>
    <h4>4. How has your view of the internet / how you experience being online changed over time?</h4>
    <p>My view of the internet has changed especially in the Online game industry. In my experience, Online games are
      super popular due to the fastest internet speed in South Korea. This also made me become obsessed by Online game
      since I entered elementary school. Online games were used to be 2D, but as I grow, the game trend has changed to
      be
      3d with visually high technological effects. As a graphic designer, it's intriguing to see and observe some
      beautiful effect when doing Online games.</p>
    <h4>5. How does the web impact graphic design?</h4>
    <p>It has a positive effect on the graphic design field because it offers more jobs and invigorates Graphic design
      industry. </p>
    <h4>6. Does web freely open to everyone in your country?</h4>
    <p>Definitely. South Korea is a democratic country, and the absolute laws say information should be open to
      everyone
      regardless of class or gender. </p>
    <h4>7. Do you have any web making experience before interactractive1?</h4>
    <p>I have never had making-experience before in my life. I even never imaged I will make a website by putting some
      complicated code. if I was not a graphic design major student. I would have used some convenient application like
      "wix" to create my website But, I do believe it is crucial for every graphic designer to know about at least
      basic
      coding knowledge and the conception of what Html or CSS is. Then you will have a broader perspective and
      opportunities as a graphic designer to try something else more.</p>
