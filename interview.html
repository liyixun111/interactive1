  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  I am a graphic design major student at CCA as an international student.
  I have been the United States for two and a half years. 
  I went to language school in Sandiego and then went to college in Boston as a freshman. After the first year at Boston, I decided to transfer to San Francisco to go to art school. My first semester at CCA was last fall2018 and this spring semester is my second semester as a sophomore. I do enjoy taking graphic design major courses here!
