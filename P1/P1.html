            <h3>Red Alert</h3>
            <h>Red Alert 2 is the very first game I played in my life. It was very popular during my elementary school
                among the boys. Since it is a game that you are the commander and you organize every soldieries and
                buildings, me and my friends usually talked about the strategies and played against with each other.
            </h>

        <div class="Description">
            <h3>Might & Magic Heroes</h3>
            <p>This game was struggled me for a while. I found this game in my cousin’s computer, and he told me it was
                good for my intelligence… I agree. I tried to play a lot of times, it seems like my intelligence was not
                there yet, and it was also a childhood pain of mine. Really hard…</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="Game Game3">
        <div class="Description">
            <h3>Warcraft III</h3>
            <p>This is one of my favorite and almost every boy born in 90s are familiar with this game because the game
                DOTA1 was very popular, and Chinese DOTA team won a lot of competition around the world, and DOTA1 was
                based on this game, meaning all the characters and maps come from the Warcraft III. There are four
                factions in the game: Humans, Orcs, Elves, and the Undead. They all have strong and weaknesses, depends
                on the duration of time. The Undead is my favorite, and I still recognize some short cut for building
                elements.</p>

    <div class="Game Game4">
        <div class="Description">
            <h3>Counter-Strike</h3>
            <p>To me, CS and Warcraft 3 are in the same level because there was a television channel mainly playing
                these two games when I was young, and I was always fighting with my grandmother for the remote control.
                I first played this game in my older cousin’s computer, and he taught me how to use some of the guns in
                the game to be more accurate.</p>

    <div class="Game Game5">
        <div class="Description">
            <h3>Diablo</h3>
            <p>Diablo is very fun to play, but I always play offline. The most thing I really enjoyed was the various
                and random attribute on the weapons and equipments and they all depends on you luckiness. And there are
                different characters in the game you can choose. I also like Undead in this game too because they can
                summon skeleton soldiers help you.</p>

    <div class="Game Game6">
        <div class="Description">
            <h3>King Of Kings</h3>
            <p>I have never played this game before, but it seems like the very first online game in China. Maybe I just
                enjoyed too much with Warcraft 3.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="Game Game7">
        <div class="Description">
            <h3>World of Warcraft</h3>
            <p>WOW was the most popular online game before the League of Legends. But I didn’t play this game when I was
                young, I played this during my high school time. 8 guys in my dormitory played together every night
                after class. Sometimes with other dormitory and also girl’s dormitory too… Very crazy and easy to be
                addicted to this game because there are sooooo many fun things you can do in this game. I was addicted
                to archaeology because you can find a lot of things with finding the treasure. So rich students were
                addicted to collecting mounts, dragons are cool to ride…</p>

    <div class="Game Game8">
        <div class="Description">
            <h3>The Legend of Mir</h3>
            <p>This seems to be the first online game I played. During my elementary school, every time I go to internet
                bar I see all the people was playing this. Seems like they can make money on this game by selling the
                weapon and equipments… </p>

    <div class="Game Game9">
        <div class="Description">
            <h3>Tencent QQ</h3>
            <p>QQ is the very first well-known social app in almost every Chinese person’s life. Now we use WeChat but
                they are from same company—Tencent. As the QQ develops, there were more things inside of it in every
                version. (I always block my parents when I post something about girlfriends).</p>

    <div class="Game Game10">
        <div class="Description">
            <h3>Young and Dangerous</h3>
            <p>This is a very influenced movie when I was young. There were a lot of students mimicking their acts in
                the movie, which caused a lot of violent among the younger generations. But the movie is very nice tho.

    <div class="Game Game11">
        <div class="Description">
            <h3>Audition Online</h3>
            <p>Seems like the first well-known game for girls because it is a dance game. A lot of funny history of this
                game. This game is a pain for internet bars because when people play this game, they always smash the
                space key very hardly in order to make them look COOL… During this game popular time, you cannot find a
                healthy space key in every internet bar.</p>
