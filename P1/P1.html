                Blizzard Entertainment on December 31, 1996.</p>

            <p>Set in the fictional Kingdom of Khanduras in the mortal realm, Diablo makes the player take control of
                a lone hero battling to rid the world of Diablo, the Lord of Terror. Beneath the fictional town of
                Tristram, the player journeys through sixteen randomly generated dungeon levels, ultimately entering
                Hell itself in order to face Diablo.</p>
